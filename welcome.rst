Welcome!
========

1. Learning goals
-----------------

For you:

* purpose and feel of tools;
* basic command line;
* 80% of way to a complete analysis;

For me:

* two day workshops, with Amazon...
* Davis! Do things work differently in sunny California?

2. Safe space and code of conduct
---------------------------------

This is intended to be a safe place for learning! Please ask questions,
because I guarantee you that your question will help others!

Please see the Software Carpentry workshop Code of Conduct: http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html

3. Instructor introductions
---------------------------

4. Amazon and cloud computing - why?!
-------------------------------------

5. Sticky notes and how they work... + Minute Cards
---------------------------------------------------

6. Warning:
-----------

The bit that isn't going to work is at the beginning.  This is unavoidable.
To reward you, we have a coffee break at 10:15am...
